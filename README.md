# PSUAI800_ConnectFour
This project will expand on the original design of the game and play an extended version of Connect Four, called Connect Four++ with the following changes: Support custom board sizes (default 8Ã—8). Allow variable win conditions (connect 4 or connect 5). Include a gravity toggle (Classic gravity mode or Zero gravity (place anywhere)).
